# KNN-Classification-using-Scikit-learn

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the Iris flower dataset. The goal is to explore the impact of different values of 𝐾 and feature combinations on the classification accuracy. The notebook is structured with descriptive Markdown sections for each part of the code to ensure clarity.
